# brainomatic
Brainomatic - a simple software tool for hacky / educational single-channel EEG recordings. 

Please enjoy using the software, but use with care - it's probably buggy and I provide no warranty with it.

## Running from source code (Matlab)

System requirements:
- Matlab
- Matlab Signal Processing Toolbox
- Statistical Parameteric Mapping (SPM)

Simply navigate in Matlab to the brainomatic folder and run brainomatic.m

## Running standalone (Mac)
In the for_redistribution folder, select MyAppInstaller_Web. This will download the necassery Matlab libraries (~400MB) and then run the software.
